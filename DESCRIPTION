Description: This is a unified copula-based framework which tests for secondary phenotypes association and a single SNP in presence of selection bias. The method fits both retrospective and prosepctive likelihoods to handel selection bias under case-contro (CC), extreme-trait (ET) and mulitple-trait (MT) sampling designs. The dependence between primary and secondary phenotypes is modelled via copulas. Thus, SPAC is a robust method for non-normality assumptiom of the secondary trait.
